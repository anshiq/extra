Basic tmux keybindings

Tmux provides several keybindings to execute commands quickly in a tmux session. Here are some of the most useful ones.

First, create a new tmux session if you're not already in one. You can name your session by passing the parameter -s {name} to the tmux new command when creating a new session:

$ tmux new -s Session1

    Ctrl+B D — Detach from the current session.
    Ctrl+B % — Split the window into two panes horizontally.
    Ctrl+B " — Split the window into two panes vertically.
    Ctrl+B Arrow Key (Left, Right, Up, Down) — Move between panes.
    Ctrl+B X — Close pane.
    Ctrl+B C — Create a new window.
    Ctrl+B N or P — Move to the next or previous window.
    Ctrl+B 0 (1,2...) — Move to a specific window by number.
    Ctrl+B : — Enter the command line to type commands. Tab completion is available.
    Ctrl+B ? — View all keybindings. Press Q to exit.
    Ctrl+B W — Open a panel to navigate across windows in multiple sessions.

For additional keybindings, consult the tmux man pages.
