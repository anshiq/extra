First you need to create /etc/rc.local file, if it doesn't exists.
 sudo vi /etc/rc.local
Contents of rc.local File
#!/bin/bash -e
#
# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.

#Command or script that you want to execute it on boot
#Assume, I want to run script
/home/ubuntu/startup_demo

exit 0
Test script startup_demo
./startup_demo
Make sure /etc/rc.local file is executable.
 sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local
Test script /etc/rc.local
/etc/rc.local
Finally, enable the service on system boot.
 sudo systemctl enable rc-local
Reboot system to check
 sudo reboot
You can check the status if you type the following command in terminal:
 sudo systemctl status rc-local
